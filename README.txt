== Description ==

A Wordpress plugin for easy creation of Polish public information bulletin (Biuletyn Informacji Publicznej, or BIP) websites by NGOs and institutions.

The plugin adds a new type of page to your Wordpress installagtion, called a "BIP page".

In accordance with the Polish public information access act ([ustawa o dostÄ™pie do informacji publicznej](http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20011121198)), each BIP page displayes the following information in its footer:
* the date of its creation,
* the date of its last modification,
* its author.

Additionally, the extension automatically creates a rudimentary editable main page for your BIP (containing all the information required by law), as well as a page with basic usage instructions (also required by law).
